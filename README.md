Interest in popular science raises day by day all around the world. Creating an environment where pop sciencers could ask questions and find answers to their science questions, read blogs about science topics, could follow their favourite academicians and could be informed of science news will let them interact with each other. This project could bring science lovers together that are from all around the globe and could make them be able to take their daily doses of popular science. Thanks to this app humans could be informed of the nature of the universe they are living in.
